#-t              : Allocate a pseudo-tty
#-i              : Keep STDIN open even if not attached
#For interactive processes (like a shell), you must use -i -t together in order to allocate a tty for the container process
#Specifying -t is forbidden when the client is receiving its standard input from a pipe : $ echo test | docker run -i busybox cat
